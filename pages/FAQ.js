                We are a group of volunteers helping Massachusetts residents get
                vaccinated. Our site uses a mix of automated and crowdsourced
                data to show vaccine appointment availability. VaccinateMA

                covers 100+ additional local and retail sites. We use a

                Why do you have vaccination locations not on other websites?
            </h2>
            <p>
                We regularly research where the vaccine is being administered
                across the state, which sometimes results in our website having
                locations not listed elsewhere.

            <h2>Why is your data out of date?</h2>
            <p>
                Most of our availability information is gathered by hand by a
                group of dedicated volunteers. Some sites only get updated once
                a day -- the time at which the data was last updated can be
                found under &quot;last updated.&quot; We encourage you to check{' '}
